## Task 2: Interpret the Performance of the Phishing Email Simulation

### Task Overview

**Objective:**  
After running the phishing simulation in Task 1, it’s time to **analyze the results** and use them to deliver targeted **phishing prevention training**. The goal is to identify which teams are most vulnerable to phishing and design training to reduce the risk of future attacks.

### What You'll Learn

- How to interpret the results of a phishing simulation to identify vulnerable teams.
- How to design and implement **targeted training** for teams with higher failure rates.
- How to evaluate and improve overall **security awareness** across the company.

### What You'll Do

- Analyze the results of the phishing simulation.
- Identify the **most vulnerable teams** based on their click-through and phishing success rates.
- Create a **presentation** to deliver phishing prevention training, focusing on areas needing improvement.
- Implement the training to **lower phishing risks** for affected teams.

### Phishing Simulation Results

The phishing simulation was conducted across multiple teams, and the results have been compiled in the table below:

| **Team**           | **Email Open Rate** | **Email Click-Through Rate** | **Phishing Success Rate** |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **IT**             | 80%                 | 2%                           | 0%                        |
| **HR**             | 100%                | 85%                          | 75%                       |
| **Card Services**  | 60%                 | 50%                          | 10%                       |
| **Reception**      | 40%                 | 10%                          | 0%                        |
| **Engineering**    | 70%                 | 4%                           | 1%                        |
| **Marketing**      | 65%                 | 40%                          | 38%                       |
| **R&D**            | 50%                 | 5%                           | 2%                        |
| **Overall Average**| 66%                 | 28%                          | 18%                       |

#### Key Definitions:
- **Email Open Rate**: The percentage of people who opened the phishing email.
- **Email Click-Through Rate**: The percentage of people who clicked on the phishing link.
- **Phishing Success Rate**: The percentage of people who clicked the link and entered personal information (e.g., passwords).

#### Next Steps:
Based on this data, it’s clear that some teams are more vulnerable to phishing attempts than others. For instance, the **HR team** has a high open rate and a **75% phishing success rate**, indicating they need immediate attention and training.

### Identify the Most Vulnerable Teams

- **HR Team**: With a **100% open rate** and **85% click-through rate**, HR has the highest vulnerability. Their **phishing success rate** is **75%**, meaning the majority of their members are falling for the phishing attack.
  
- **Marketing Team**: The **click-through rate** of **40%** and a **phishing success rate** of **38%** shows they are another highly vulnerable team that needs immediate attention.

- **Card Services**: The team has a relatively high **click-through rate** of **50%**, but their phishing success rate is relatively low at **10%**. They might need to focus on improving their reporting and awareness.

### Resources

Here are some resources to help you better interpret the results:

- **Email Open Rate**: This is the percentage of people who opened the phishing email. A high open rate indicates that the email was crafted convincingly.
- **Click-Through Rate**: This shows the percentage of employees who clicked on the phishing link. A higher rate suggests that the email's link was appealing or convincing.
- **Phishing Success Rate**: This indicates the percentage of employees who fell for the phishing attack by entering personal information. A higher rate means that employees were not just tricked into opening the email but also into **providing sensitive data**.

### Create a Short Presentation

Now that you’ve analyzed the results and identified the most vulnerable teams, it’s time to create a **short presentation** (3-5 slides) that will provide phishing awareness and training to those teams.

You can find the presentation you’ve created below:

#### [Phishing Awareness Training Presentation](#)

(Replace `#` with the actual link or path to the presentation file)

### Conclusion

In this task, you interpreted the results of the phishing email simulation and identified the teams most vulnerable to phishing attempts. You then created a targeted training presentation to help raise **security awareness** and reduce the risk of phishing attacks across the company.
