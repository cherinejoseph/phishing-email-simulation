# Phishing Simulation Campaign â€“ Mastercard

## Project Overview

This project is part of a **phishing simulation task** I completed through **Forage**, a platform that offers virtual job simulations. In this simulation, I played the role of an analyst on Mastercard's **Security Awareness Team**. The project consisted of two key tasks that focused on creating a phishing email and analyzing the effectiveness of phishing simulations. The goal of the project was to build awareness and help Mastercard employees identify and prevent phishing threats.

## Task 1: Create a Believable Phishing Email

In **Task 1**, I was tasked with creating a **realistic phishing email** to simulate a potential phishing attempt targeting Mastercard employees. The goal was to craft an email that appeared legitimate to increase the likelihood of employees interacting with it during a phishing simulation campaign.

**Key Objective**: To improve an obvious fake phishing email, making it contextual, relevant, and convincing for a Mastercard employee.

## Task 2: Analyze Responses and Improve Future Simulations

In **Task 2**, I evaluated how employees responded to the phishing emails in the simulation. This task involved reviewing the results of the phishing simulation campaign, identifying weaknesses, and providing recommendations for improving future phishing simulations.

**Key Objective**: To analyze employee responses to phishing attempts and propose strategies for enhancing future phishing awareness campaigns.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained an in-depth understanding of phishing threats and their impact on organizations.
- Learned how to craft realistic phishing emails that mimic real-world attacks.
- Analyzed employee behavior in response to phishing attempts and developed insights for future campaigns.
- Enhanced ability to identify and mitigate security risks within a corporate environment.

## Skills You Will Learn and Practice

This simulation helped me gain valuable skills in the following areas:

- **Cybersecurity**: Understanding the broader landscape of cybersecurity threats, particularly phishing, and how they impact organizations.
- **Technical Security Awareness**: Recognizing and addressing security threats in an organizational context.
- **Problem Solving**: Analyzing phishing emails and responses to find solutions that improve future simulations.
- **Design Thinking**: Applying a user-centered approach to designing phishing simulations that effectively teach employees to identify security threats.
- **Communication**: Crafting clear, convincing emails that simulate phishing attacks and help employees improve their awareness of cybersecurity.
- **Security Awareness Training**: Developing and delivering training programs to help employees recognize phishing attempts and avoid compromising sensitive data.
- **Data Analysis**: Interpreting data from phishing simulations to evaluate employee responses and make data-driven improvements.
- **Data Presentation**: Presenting insights from phishing simulation results in an organized, actionable format for stakeholders.
