# Task 1: Craft a phishing email simulation to be used to raise awareness of one of the most common threats organizations today face.

## Task Overview

You are an **analyst in our Security Awareness Team**. Our **Chief Security Officer (CSO)** relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to Mastercard.

One of the most common threats organizations face today is **phishing**. So, what is phishing?

**Phishing** is the act of pretending to be someone/something in order to steal sensitive information, often **passwords**. Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with **malicious software** or lure them into providing **financial information, system credentials**, or other sensitive data. 

Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like **Mastercard** millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So, it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by **educating** our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through **phishing simulation campaigns**:

- We test our staff every month by sending a **fake phishing email** designed to look like something a **bad actor** would send.
- We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement **future training**.

In this task, you will craft a **phishing email simulation** to raise awareness of one of the most common cybersecurity threats: **phishing attacks**. Specifically, the focus will be on **password reset phishing**, which is one of the most frequently encountered types of phishing attacks in organizations.

The goal of this simulation is to design a **realistic phishing email** that mimics a typical attack to help employees recognize and respond appropriately to such threats.

### Key Learning Objectives
- **Understand the mechanics** of phishing attacks, particularly password reset phishing.
- Learn how to **mask malicious links** behind seemingly legitimate URLs.
- Craft a **believable email** with correct spelling, grammar, and professional formatting to make it appear genuine.
- Recognize the importance of context and urgency in phishing emails to manipulate employees into taking action.
- Design a **security awareness simulation** that will help employees become more vigilant against phishing threats.

## Original Phishing Email (Obvious Fake)

Here’s the **obvious fake phishing email** provided in the task. This email is easily recognizable as a phishing attempt due to multiple red flags (e.g., suspicious sender address, lack of context, and a visible malicious link).

### **Original Phishing Email**

```text
From: mastercardsIT@gmail.com  
To: employee@email.com  
Subject: URGENT! Password Reset Required—

Body:

Hello (insert name),

Your email account has been compromised. Immediate action is required to reset your password!

Click here to reset your password in the next hour or your account will be locked: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)

Regards, Mastercard IT

```
### Obvious Fake Elements

1. **Suspicious Sender Address**: 
   The email comes from `mastercardsIT@gmail.com`, which is not a legitimate Mastercard address. 
   Legitimate corporate emails will always use a company domain (e.g., `it-support@mastercard.com`), not a generic public email provider like Gmail.

2. **Lack of Personalization**: 
   The greeting says “Hello (insert name)”, which is a dead giveaway that the email isn’t personalized. 
   Real companies send emails addressing employees by their name, e.g., "Hello [Employee Name]".

3. **Urgency Without Explanation**: 
   "Immediate action is required" is a red flag. Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency to provoke hasty action. However, there's no explanation of why the account was compromised or how it was detected, which is suspicious.

4. **Visible Malicious Link**: 
   The link in the email goes to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing`, which is an obvious sign that it's not a legitimate password reset link. 
   Legitimate password reset links will always point to trusted internal domains, not external sites like Wikipedia.

5. **Unprofessional Language**: 
   The email lacks professionalism in both tone and presentation. Phrasing like "Your email account has been compromised" without context or follow-up instruction raises immediate suspicion.

## The Improved Phishing Email

Now that we've identified the fake elements, it’s time to improve the phishing email. The goal is to make it **more believable** by adding legitimacy, urgency, and professionalism.

### **Key Improvements:**

- **Professional Sender Address**
- **Personalization**
- **Legitimate Link**
- **Urgency with Context**
- **Helpdesk Information**

## Conclusion

In this task, I crafted a **phishing email simulation** designed to raise awareness about one of the most common security threats faced by organizations: **phishing**. 

By creating a more **believable phishing email**, I practiced the following skills:
- **Identifying and improving phishing threats** to make them more realistic.
- **Crafting professional emails** that mimic legitimate communications from organizations.
- **Enhancing cybersecurity awareness** by understanding how phishing attacks are structured to manipulate the recipient.

Additionally, this task emphasizes the importance of **continuous security education** and the role of **phishing simulations** in testing employees’ ability to identify threats, which ultimately helps in reducing potential security breaches at Mastercard.

By implementing phishing simulations and awareness training, companies like Mastercard can significantly **mitigate the risk** of phishing and other social engineering attacks that may result in substantial financial and reputational losses.

This task helped me understand the critical role that security awareness plays in an organization's overall cybersecurity strategy.
